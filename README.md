# winning_lottery_number_tracker
Python script that pulls winning lottery (Powerball) numbers from online and gives you the winningest numbers.
The winning numbers data begins back from 2010 till present.  Please refer to the website in the link below for any additional information. 

To run the program you must have python3 installed.  Then simply run:
  python win_lotto_num_track.py
  
The link to the lottery numbers is updated by this site: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/lottery-powerball-winning-numbers-beginning-2010

I would like to eventually add an algorithm to discern which top five numbers are chosen "together" the most.  As of now this is all I have finished.
